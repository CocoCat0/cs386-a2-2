Hello everyone! You can call me Alyssa or Izzy. I enjoy making drawings and 
paintings; it makes me happy. I also enjoy diving into books of deeper topics
such as:

- Grendel
- Damien
- Fahrenheit 451

As of now I'm just existing on this dimensional plane which is called Earth,
where time stands at a still. I could hear, I could think, yet I am not
heard. You may know my name but I don't know my own. I know all the beings
on Earth, yet I don't know the being I am. Am I this, Am I that? Who knows
until time will tell
